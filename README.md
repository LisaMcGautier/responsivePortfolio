# responsivePortfolio

The first 10 or so commits of this portfolio project (under a different repository; homework2) were my efferets to recreate, using HTML and Bootstrap, several sample images provided.

I struggled with the responsiveness of the navbar, especially at the small and extra-small breakpoints.

Today, I used the grid system of rows and columns to achieve the aesthetic that I orginally intended.

I also realized that the contact.html page was intended for personal contact information, not an interactive form to be completed by a user.

I have also included additional HTML documents that represent various stages of experimenting with Bootstrap and HTML.

Per feedback, I created a new repository, and will also include screen shots and links to the improved pages.
